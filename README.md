=========

# Introduction

DirectX 11 Set of of nodes for VVVV.

# How to install

This project uses a small dx11 toolkit called FeralTic, it is installed as submodule in this repository.

To contribute to FeralTic please clone the project independently at https://github.com/mrvux/FeralTic

Since it uses a submodule, installation is a tiny bit different:

* fork and clone as usual

* git submodule init

* git submodule update

You should have a working project from this.

Contributions/Bug Fixes/Feature request are of course welcomed!!
